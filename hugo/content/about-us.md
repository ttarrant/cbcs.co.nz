Established in January of 2008, Complete Body Corp Solutions provides quality Body Corporate management services throughout the greater Wellington region.

Ben Duflou (Director & Chartered Accountant) and Shayne Thurston (Director & Property Management Specialist) co-founded CBCS to provide a wide range of property, building management and accounting services to bodies corporate, company share and cross lease properties in Wellington and its surrounding localities. CBCS have an association with one of New Zealandâ€™s leading solicitors on unit titled properties (Vesna Wells) to provide a complete and comprehensive body corporate support service to CBCS clients.

CBCS has a complete understanding of the Unit titles Act 2010 and its provisions and building management matters. We have experience working with Heritage listed buildings, Earthquake listed buildings, and the associated issues with these . CBCS has worked with developers in the set up of new body corporates for buildings and we have also transitioned many building across to our management.
