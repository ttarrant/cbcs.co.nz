We work with developers from the initial design stage, so we have a proven record of Body Corporate establishment. From setting the  budgets, preparing all the necessary documentation and holding the first Body Corporate meetings, we have worked with developers to make this part of their development, stress free.!
 
We cover:
 
- Budgeting;
- Review of legal documentation;
- Preparing pre-contact disclosures, pre-settlement disclosures and additional disclosure  statements;
- Preparation of Turnover Documents (when 75% ownership threshold breached);
- Creation of policies and procedural handbook for each unit;
- Assistance with setting up of Body Corporate rules;
- Establishment of body corporate database;
- Documentation of key infrastructure information;
- Calling and running of first Body Corporate meeting (until chairperson elected);
- Establishment of filing system; and 
- Establishment of master key registry.
 
 
We look forward to discussing your next Body Corporate set up with you.
