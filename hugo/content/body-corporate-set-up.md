CBCS set up our first Body Corporate in 2008. We work with developers for the itnial deisgn stage, and we have a proven record of Body Corporate establishment. 
Working with you from the initial design stage, so we have a proven record of Body Corporate establishment. From setting the  budgets, preparing all the necessary documentation and holding the first Body Corporate meetings, we have worked with developers to make this part of their development, stress free!
 
**Our body corporate set up services cover:**

- Documentation of key infrastructure information
- Calling and running of first Body Corporate meeting (until chairperson elected)

We look forward to discussing your next Body Corporate set up with you.
