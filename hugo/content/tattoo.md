# Welcome to the Tattoo Apartments.

The Tattoo Apartments are a funky low rise complex comprising of 36 two level one bedroom apartments. The bedroom and bathroom are on the mezzanine floor and the living space takes in the ground floor. These are exciting and superb apartments that will appeal greatly to people looking to reside in the vibrant Upper Cuba area of Wellington City.

Located in Abel Smith Street just moments from bars and cafes, and a few minutes from shops and entertainment, this is a great building in a fantastic location.

Tattoo Apartments are run and administered by Complete Body Corp Solutions Ltd in conjuction with a Body Corporate Committee and facilitated by a professional Body Corporate Secretary.  Both the committee and secretary meet as necessary to keep the building maintained and functioning as planned.

It is a friendly community and with a little care and effort, we can all help keep Tattoo a great place to live.



Rubbish collection for Tattoo Apartments is Weekly, on Mondays and Fridays. Please help keep our apartments tidy!
 
Recycling â€“ Wellington City Council Collection in the Inner City

In the central business district, residents' recycling is collected every Tuesdays after 5.30pm. Only clear plastic bags are to be used - not the green glass crates used in the suburban recycling collections.

Residents should sort their recycling into plastic bags and place out on the footpath on the Abel Smith St side of the building, between 5.30pm and 10.00pm every Tuesday night.

Put paper and cardboard into one clear plastic bag, and glass, tins, cans and plastic into another clear plastic bag.

All recycling materials must be sorted and placed in plastic bags or they will not be collected.
