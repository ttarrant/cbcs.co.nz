CBCS will host and facilitate your AGMS. We have a dedicated boardroom in Wellington city, which is fully equipped with a projector and refreshments provided.
 
Our team will run the AGM and walk you through each step of the process, ensuring each resolution is discussed and that votes are accurately recorded.
 
We also budget to attend up to four of your committee meetings each year and these can be held at our boardroom.
