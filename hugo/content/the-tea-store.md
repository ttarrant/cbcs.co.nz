# The Tea Store:

*Welcome to the Tea Store*

The Tea Store Apartments are situated on 20 Egmont Street, Te Aro, Wellington. This apartment complex consists of 19 residential units. These apartments are completed with 1-4 bedrooms with such a modern and unique style.

The Tea Store Apartments are located in the centre of both Cuba Quarter and Courtenay Place. So you are only moments away from bars, cafes and a few minutes from shops and entertainment. Also terrific place if you are a worker in Wellington CBD. 

The Tea Store Apartments are run and administered by Complete Body Corp Solutions Ltd in conjunction with a Body Corporate Committee and facilitated by a professional Body Corporate Secretary.  Both the committee and secretary meet as necessary to keep the building maintained and functioning as planned.

It is a friendly community and with a little care and effort, we can all help keep The Tea Store a great place to live.
