# Disclosure Statements

As required under the Unit Titles Act 2010, we prepare pre-contract, pre-settlement and additional information disclosure statements for Unit owners on request.

Our costs for the preparation of these documents are $200+GST for pre-contract and pre-settlement statements and $250+GST for additional information disclosure statements. We can usually produce these disclosure statements within 24 hours.

We invoice these directly to the Unit owners, so this not a cost to the Body Corporate.
